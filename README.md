# Smart contract FE interpret
Written in the Blazor framework. It allows the user to interpret models created by https://github.com/ancinpet/smart-contract-fe-designer. Created for my thesis https://github.com/ancinpet/domain-specific-languages-for-off-chain-ui-in-decentralized-applications.

Currently, only the Ethereum network is supported. This application lets you generate front-end for Ethereum smart contracts with custom front-end validations and flows, which should make user interaction with your smart contract simple, easy to understand and also portable.
